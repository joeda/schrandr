# schrandr

If you use _xrandr_ to configure a set of monitors more than once, there is something wrong.

I would probably call it experimental, but this would imply that there is a at least a chance of an interesting result. Expect changes in the used libraries and general project structure.

### Milestones

1. A daemon that runs, detects changes in Monitor connections and logs them.

2. ~~Detecting the current Monitor setup and (de)serializing it.~~

3. Reading and Writing setups to file and comparing them to the current setup.

4. ~~Eliminating XLib~~

5. ~~Getting the current screen setup~~

6. ~~(De)serializing screen setups and comparing them~~

7. ~~Setting screen setup~~

8. Review Logging

9. Review Error Handling

10. Release!
